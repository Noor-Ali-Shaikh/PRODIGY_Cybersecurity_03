# PRODIGY_Cybersecurity_03
# Password Complexity Checker 🔐

A Python-based GUI tool that assesses the strength of a password in real-time based on length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides instant feedback with a percentage score and congratulates users when a strong password is entered.

## Features ✨
✅ Real-time password strength analysis
✅ Instant feedback with color-coded strength levels
✅ Percentage score indicating password strength
✅ User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
✅ Lightweight and easy to use

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Python** 🐍
- **Tkinter** (GUI framework)
- **Regex (re module)** for pattern matching

## How It Works 🔐
1. User types a password in the input field.
2. The tool evaluates the password based on five security parameters:
   - Minimum length of 8 characters
   - Presence of numbers
   - Presence of lowercase letters
   - Presence of uppercase letters
   - Presence of special characters
3. The password strength is displayed in real-time with:
   - A **color-coded label** (Weak, Moderate, Strong, etc.)
   - A **percentage indicator**
   - A **congratulatory message** when 100% strength is reached

## Usage 📷
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/password-complexity-checker.git
   cd password-complexity-checker
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python password_checker.py
   ```
3. Start typing a password and see its strength in real-time!
